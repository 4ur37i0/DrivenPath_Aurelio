# DrivenPath

## Description
**DrivenPath** is a Data Engineering Retraining Program repository. It is designed to guide junior engineers and professionals transitioning into the field of Data Engineering. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice, anybody can learn how to build, deploy, and manage data pipelines, ultimately creating a comprehensive project applicable to a real-world scenario.\
In this program, any user can learn theoretical and practical aspects to become a proficient Data Engineer by building a complete data pipeline for a simulate small business. The scenario-driven approach ensures that users not only learn the technical skills but also understand how to apply them in a practical context.

## Repository Structure
DrivenPath is devided in **chapters**.\
If you want to get from zero and at the final to be able to get a Professional Certification or a Junior Big Data Engineer role, follow all the chapters in established order.\
If you want just refresh the knowledge of specific area, go stright forward to that chapter.

### Chapters
Each chapter is focusing on one specific topic and contain theoretical and practical parts.

└───instructions_1.md
```

#### Chapter 1: Scenario
The whole repository is built around a real-world scenario. Each chapter start with a specific part from this scenario and further provide theoretical notions to understand how to implement this part. Also, almost all chapters contain practical part of implementation to fulfill this part.  

#### Chaper 2: Big Data Engineering
Big Data Engineering chapter contain notions about the Big Data field.
