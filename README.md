# DrivenPath

## Description
**DrivenPath** is a Data Engineering Retraining Program repository. It is designed to guide junior engineers and professionals transitioning into the field of Data Engineering. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice, anybody can learn how to build, deploy, and manage data pipelines, ultimately creating a comprehensive project applicable to a real-world scenario.\
In this program, any user can learn theoretical and practical aspects to become a proficient Data Engineer by building a complete data pipeline for a simulate small business. The scenario-driven approach ensures that users not only learn the technical skills but also understand how to apply them in a practical context.

## Repository Structure
DrivenPath is devided in **chapters**.\
If you want to get from zero and at the final to be able to get a Professional Certification or a Junior Big Data Engineer role, follow all the chapters in established order.\
If you want just refresh the knowledge of specific area, go stright forward to that chapter.

### Chapter structure
Each chapter is focusing on one specific topic and contain theoretical and practical parts.

```
chapter_1
├───src_1
|   |───example.py
|   └───sample.sql
├───work_1
|   └───scenario_1.md
└───README.md
```
In each chapter there are two main directories `src_n` and `work_n`. The `src_n` directory is designed to contain all code and data generated by the author for *DrivenData*. You can use this code for replication work. The `work_n` directory contains only one file `scenario_n.md` where are described scenario for current chapter and tasks to be implemented for *LeadData* scenario. The `scenario_n.md` file is for your personal implementation.

### Chapter description
The whole repository is built around a real-world scenario. Each chapter start with a specific part from this scenario and further provide theoretical notions to understand how to implement this part. Also, almost all chapters contain practical part of implementation to fulfill this part.  

#### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Big Data Engineering](chapter_1/README.md)
First chapter contain notions about the Big Data field as theoretical part. Create accounts and install all necessary softwares as practical part. 

#### [Chaper 2: Batch processing - Local Development](chapter_2/README.md)
Second chapter contain notions about ETL, Normalization, Denormalization, and technologies as theoretical part. Extract, transform, and load data as practical part.

#### [Chaper 3: Batch processing - Local Pipeline](chapter_3/README.md)
Third chapter contain notions about Docker and Airflow as theoretical part. Containerize Airflow, database, and dbt as practical part.

#### [Chaper 4: Batch processing - Cloud: Console pipeline](chapter_4/README.md)
Fourth chapter contain notions about Amazon Web Services as theoretical part. Setup AWS services and Airflow as practical part.

#### [Chaper 5: Batch processing - Cloud: Automated pipeline](chapter_5/README.md)
Fifth chapter contain notions about IAM and Terraform as theoretical part. Setup IAM role, Terraform for test, and Terraform for pipeline as practical part.

#### [Chaper 6: Batch processing - CI/CD pipeline](chapter_6/README.md)
Sixth chapter contain notions about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, and GitHub Actions as theoretical part. Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions as practical part.

## Getting Started
1. Login to GitHub.\
Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and `Sign in` using your credentials or create new account using `Sign up` if don't have one and follow instructions from *Chapter 1*.

2. Navigate to DrivenPath.\
Navigate to [DrivenPath](https://github.com/romanmurzac/DrivenPath) repository.

3. Fork DrivenPath.\
Once you're in DrivenPath repository main page, click on `Fork` option as in image below and proceed to the next page.
![Fork DrivenPath.](media/image_0.1.PNG "Fork DrivenPath")

4. Complete Fork.\
Complete fork information in order to obtain a copy of the original repository. This copy of repository will be your personal space to go through the whole learning process.

5. Clone Your DrivenPath.\
On your local computer open a terminal and choose where you want to store the *DrivenPath* project, in command below replace `repository-path` with your actual path. Also, replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.
```
cd <repository-path>
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DrivenPath.git
```

6. Create Branch.\
There recomendation is to create a separate branch for each chapter. In terminal introduce the command below by replacing the `no` with the chapter number.
```
git checkout -b chapter_<no>
```

7. Create Virtual Environment.\
Create virtual environment to avoid any conflict in your projects structures.
Install virtual environments, create virtual environments and activate it. Activate the virtual environment as first step on your work sessions.
```
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

8. Push changes.\
On each step that you perform commit your changes and push them at the end of working period.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Chapter <no>: Update SQL for create_pii_data.sql file."
git push
```
