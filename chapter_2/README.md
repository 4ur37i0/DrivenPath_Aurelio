## Theory
Main theoretical notions of the chapter with proper resources for self paced learning.

### ETL
#### Description
ETL meaning extract, transform, load; is a data integration process that combines, cleans and organizes data from multiple sources into a single, consistent data set for storage in a data warehouse, data lake or other target system.

### Batch processing
#### Description
Batch processing is a computational technique in which a collection of data is amassed and then processed in a single operation, often without the need for real-time interaction. This approach is particularly effective for handling large volumes of data, where tasks can be executed as a group during off-peak hours to optimize system resources and throughput.

### Python
#### Description
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

### SQL
#### Description
SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.

### Extract data
#### Description
Data extraction is the process of obtaining raw data from a source and replicating that data somewhere else. The raw data can come from various sources, such as a database, Excel spreadsheet, an SaaS platform, web scraping, or others. It can then be replicated to a destination, such as a data warehouse, designed to support online analytical processing (OLAP). This can include unstructured data, disparate types of data, or simply data that is poorly organized. Once the data has been consolidated, processed, and refined, it can be stored in a central location — on-site, in cloud storage, or a hybrid of both — to await transformation or further processing.

### Framework
#### Description
Whenever you work with any programming language, you might hear about various frameworks based on that language. When you work on software, you might use any framework to enhance the quality of your application. Frameworks provide many advantages to the developers and reduce the time and effort required in the development process. They enable developers to write clean code that is easily understandable by others.
